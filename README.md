# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
 it is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?Scope:

Software Engineering: Encompasses the entire process of software development, including planning, analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It involves collaboration, project management, and adherence to methodologies and best practices.
Traditional Programming: Focuses primarily on writing code to solve specific problems or create particular functionalities. It is a subset of the software engineering process and typically does not involve the broader context of project management and lifecycle considerations.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):Planning:

Define the scope and purpose of the project.
Conduct feasibility studies and resource allocation.
Requirements Analysis:

Gather and analyze user requirements.
Document functional and non-functional requirements.
Design:

Create system and software design documents.
Plan the architecture and components of the system.
Implementation (Coding):

Write the actual code based on design documents.
Use programming languages and tools to build the software.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
